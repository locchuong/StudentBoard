# StudentBoard
StudentBoard is a Full stack ReactJS project providing users with an online learning platform. The purpose of this project was to create a platform that combined the features of both Canvas and Piazza into one platform. Try it out [here](https://student-board-app.herokuapp.com/)!

## Features
StudentBoard provides rich features akin to that of Canvas (Course management, Assignments, Home page, Syllabus, Discussion Board, and more!). Performance and routing was optimized by using React-Boostrap and React-Router. Authentication is done through OAuth 2.0 authorization using Firebase's Authentication API. The backend was developed using Firebase's NoSQL cloud database to store user data and provide real-time updates.
